* Remove ASU units as they are not recognized by `units` (#67)
* Fix error in matching data when order of tracks differed in `mt_as_track_data` (#73)

* `.keep` in `mt_as_event_attribute` incorrectly did not add column (#74)
* Using `"merge_list"` results in list columns in `track_data` with `mt_stack`, "merge" now returns unique values (#72, Bruno Caneco)
* Update vocabulary (note speed accuracy had incorrect units)
* Update vocabulary to version released in January 2024 (note speed accuracy had incorrect units, #69)
* When `mt_set_track_id` now returns a list column the lists are unnamed
* Fix `mt_has_unique_location_time_records` failing with `int64` `POSIXct` combination (#79)

# move2 0.2.7

* Add "transmission-end" & "dead/fall-off" to deployment end type to read data correctly
* `mt_interpolate` works when column named `x` or `time` is present
* `mt_interpolate` works when timezone of `time` is different

# move2 0.2.6

* `bind_cols` and `st_join` retains class for `tbl` by fixing reconstruct function
